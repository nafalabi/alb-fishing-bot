## Albion Fishing Bot
> a simple attempt to implement a bot for fishing in albion online\
> *mainly for educational purposes*

### How it works
this bot works by sniffing
the fishing event packets, reading pixel changes and sending mouse events. No injection was done into the game client.

### Thanks to
[FashionFlora](https://github.com/FashionFlora) for his packet sniffing method on his [project](https://github.com/FashionFlora/Albion-Online-Radar-QRadar)
